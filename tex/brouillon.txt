2:: Predictive maintenant for wind turbine's main bearing
""When it comes to wind energy industry, being able to monitor the several assets present an opportunity to maximize
energy production while saving maintenance, repair, and overhaul costs [6]. In fact, the need for efficient digital twin
models reveals itself major drive-train components, such as the main bearings, dominate the maintenance costs; and
thus, it is critical to ensure operation up to and, ideally, past component design lives""
""Lubricant condition is known to be crucial in contact fatigue of main shaft bearings [49].""

3:: prédiction à court-long terme 

4:: archi et pipeline: sensor + human observation -> hybrid physics-informed neural network

<insert shéma> figure 4 a , fig 3 et les différentes equations

6:: (data) appendix B SCADA ou NREL database wind speed and ambiant temperature evry hour on 7 years -> boostraped to create measures every 10 min for up to 30 years (standart SCADA)
the main bearing temperature is described by a recursive model as a function of previous bearing temperature, nacelle temperature, angular velocity, and generated power.
essayer de faire un tableau mais va etre maigre 
NREL permet de faire le offline et scada permettrai le online

7:: (validation) je pense surtout figure 7 

8:: franchement jsp

9:: ""The modeling framework proposed in this manuscript can be leveraged for fleet
management strategies such as scheduled maintenance, work scope optimization (as demonstrated in the paper with
regreasing), and curtailment, even using cheap and simple visual inspections and without any concern for bad quality
grease. In the future, we are excited to extend our work by extrapolating a site-specific digital twin across multiple
parks using transfer learning. We also would like to explore the sustainability aspect of our digital twin, by updating
the model and distributions with new samples throughout the wind farm’s operational life with a Bayesian approach.""
