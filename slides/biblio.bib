abstract = {In the field of prognostics and health management for industrial equipment, digital twins stand out as essential tools. Wind park operators can harness the potential of digital twins to monitor component health, enabling proactive measures to optimize energy production while reducing maintenance costs. This study introduces a novel hybrid digital twin application tailored for monitoring wind turbine main bearing fatigue. It combines physics-based and data-driven kernels to address variable grease quality and biased observations. Our study covers model initialization, cross-validation, fleet management, and the influence of sampled turbines on prediction. Our approach offers two key advantages: (a) It reduces the need for extensive datasets, typical in other machine learning methods, by incorporating physics-based knowledge into the network architecture, and (b) it quantifies output uncertainties using tailored network layers and loss functions. Our findings conclude that even under compound uncertainty scenario, our hybrid model can estimate fleet unreliability only off by 4.7 weeks. However, it is essential to note that computational costs are tied to data processing, similar to other recurrent neural networks. A limitation is that the physics-based kernels must align with common machine learning linear algebra practices.}

abstract = {Pitch bearings in wind turbines are affected by reciprocating motion due to pitch control. The combination of oscillating operation, high loads, and mixed lubrication often leads to wear. Grease lubricants in wind turbine pitch bearings should be designed to avoid such wear. Due to different available grease lubricants, the anti-wear properties are investigated under downscaled wind turbine pitch bearing conditions. The downscaling is accomplished by load simulation for a pitch bearing and analysis of the pitch movements for a 7.5 MW reference turbine. The operational conditions of the four point contact ball bearing with 5 m outer diameter are scaled to angular contact ball bearings of the size 7208. The investigations are concluded with contact model experiments. Six Industrial grease lubricants for wind turbine pitch bearings are tested that follow very different compositions. The investigations reveal, that none of the tested grease lubricants was able to reduce wear for all tested conditions. After 250000 cycles certain conditions lead to severe wear. Therefore, the pitch controller should avoid such conditions if possible. Nevertheless, grease lubricants with low base oil viscosities and high bleeding rates are best on average for the tested conditions. Furthermore, the results of the bearing experiments are comparable to the model experiments.}
